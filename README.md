# Hello LocalStack

Hello reader! 😊

I've created this repository to let you know how does it feel to be Jeff Bezos, or something like that 🤣 because with this repository code you will have Amazon Web Services hosted in your local machine...
sounds crazy? (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

Well, first let me explain 🙂

In order to understand and be able to give it a look you'll need to (instead having a million of dollars or enough to pay an AWS account) :

* Docker basic knowledge

* Amazon Web Services understanding

* Maybe some Terraform or Infrastructure as Code

* And a smiling face 😝

I think that's it, let me know if I'm forgetting something ( ´･･)ﾉ(._.`)

Now, maybe you also could need a little of JavaScript, but the code part is done so let's start.

## Coding Part

Fort this exercise I created this small function:

This will be our "Hello World" code, and as you can see O(∩_∩)O

That's all the code we need 😁

### Well, not at all

We need to have installed **Docker**, **Terraform** and **aws cli** in order to be able to make something cool with our code.

Once you have those installed (or meanwhile gets installed) we can start writing our terraform scripts to create our AWS resources ヾ(≧▽≦*)o

## Terraform

Let's create a folder for our terraform scripts and start...

But first let's zip our code with a *file.tf*:

![image-20210720195918628](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAlan02/hello-localstack/9f15d93061733eda3e6fc5966fbaf228d2cf7b2e/img/image-20210720195918628.png)

Now we need a **Role with a policy** for our lambda, we can just name this file as *iam.tf*:

![image-20210720195955208](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAlan02/hello-localstack/9f15d93061733eda3e6fc5966fbaf228d2cf7b2e/img/image-20210720200154020.png)

Let's create our **AWS Lambda** function in our *lambda.tf*:

![image-20210720200154020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAlan02/hello-localstack/9f15d93061733eda3e6fc5966fbaf228d2cf7b2e/img/image-20210720195955208.png)

**Note that we are indicating to our lambda to read the file we created and also attached the role*

## Docker Compose

At this point we the installation should have been completed, and we can give a try for our **AWS local instance** (●ˇ∀ˇ●)

We need to create a compose file, let's keep it in the root to make easier to access:
![image-20210720200442709](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAlan02/hello-localstack/9f15d93061733eda3e6fc5966fbaf228d2cf7b2e/img/image-20210720200442709.png)

This file contains the main ingredient for our **Amazon Local Instance**!

What we are doing here is basically indicate which AWS resources we're creating to emulate (because we are emulating AWS, we don't have a super powerful computer to have a real local instance 😢), and also some other important indications that will allow to execute the lambda locally 😁

Now it's matter to run **docker compose build**, go inside our terraform folder and run **terraform init**, **plan** and **apply** and just see how the magic happens...

Once the lambda gets created we can run:
aws lambda invoke --function-name aws_hello_fc --endpoint=<http://localhost:4566/> output.txt

Where "aws_hello_fc" is the name of our lambda and "output.txt" is the file where the lambda's output (duh 🤦‍♂️) will be write.

And that's how you can get Amazon Web services in your local machine 😊

I leaved some other stuffs (just an **API Gateway** integration with the lambda) there, you can give it a try if you want, but please **READ THE DOCUMENTATION** (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)

Enjoy (￣y▽￣)╭ Ohohoho.....
